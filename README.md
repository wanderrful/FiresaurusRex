Experience the courage of Rex, the plush dinosaur of a little girl whose fear of fire has consumed her life. Despite being highly flammable, it is up to Rex to do everything he can to comfort this young girl by picking up a fire hose and donning the hat of a firefighter as he battles the girlâ€™s fear head on.

Firesaurus Rex is a story about loss, fear, sadness, and how even the smallest bit of courage can bring comfort. Play as a Fire-fighting plush, and experience a world through the eyes of a child whose imagination has been plagued. Douse the fear of flame and protect the ones you love the most.
